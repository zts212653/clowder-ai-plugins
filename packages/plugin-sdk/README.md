Runtime helpers and typed Host boundaries for Clowder AI plugins.

`context.config.get` and `context.secrets.get` expose the plugin-activation snapshot. After an operation changes configuration, runtime paths must use the values currently held by the live process or adapter rather than rereading that snapshot.
