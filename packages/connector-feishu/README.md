# Feishu / Lark Connector

`@clowder-ai/connector-feishu` packages authenticated Feishu/Lark webhook and long-connection message
parsing, interactive cards, media transfer, token refresh, and QR credential setup for a Clowder AI Host.

## Configuration

The Host projects only the declared App ID, App Secret, connection mode, optional verification token, and
optional group mention aliases. The package does not read repository `.env` files or ambient Host state.

## Security and authority

The Host owns installation, grants, secrets, webhook admission, connector bindings, wake policy, delivery,
and durable state. Ordinary message text, including `@`, cannot mint a binding or wake an Agent.

## Lifecycle and recovery

Tenant tokens and downloaded media are transient runtime data. Rollback drains the package connection before
the preserved Core adapter starts, while Host-owned bindings and configuration remain unchanged.

The Host-loadable builtin runtime is implemented in this package and uses only the existing authenticated
binding and declared configuration/secret surfaces. No package-local persistence fallback is provided.

## Exposed capability

The connector contributes one Feishu identity, connector surface, and verified webhook, requests `plugin.config.read`, `messaging.send`, `secret.read`. QR setup obtains credentials but does not transfer Host configuration authority.
