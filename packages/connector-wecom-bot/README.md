# WeCom Bot Connector

`@clowder-ai/connector-wecom-bot` packages WeCom intelligent-bot WebSocket ingress, proactive replies,
frame-bound streaming, template cards, and encrypted media transfer for a Clowder AI Host.

## Configuration

- `botId`: WeCom intelligent-bot identity.
- `botSecret`: secret used only to authenticate the provider WebSocket session.

The Host owns the validate/connect operation and projects only these declared values. The package does not
read repository `.env` files or ambient Host configuration.

## Security and authority

The Host owns installation, grants, secrets, connector bindings, wake policy, delivery, and durable state.
Inbound provider messages target only an authenticated Host-issued `connector_binding`. Group `@bot` text
may be normalized as provider syntax, but package text never decides Host admission or wake authority.

## Lifecycle and recovery

Disable and rollback drain the WebSocket, timers, cached frames, and active streams before another runtime
starts. Resume state and deduplication watermarks must use a Host-owned, manifest-declared checkpoint after
accepted delivery; package-local files, ambient Redis, and inventory snapshots are not substitutes.

The Host-loadable builtin runtime is implemented in this package and uses only the existing authenticated
binding, declared configuration/secret, state, and messaging surfaces; C1 does not add another public wire.

## Exposed capability

The connector contributes WeCom messaging and requests only `messaging.send`. It does not expose C2 audio
services, mention parsing, public UI slots, or generic public hooks.
